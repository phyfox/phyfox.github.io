# Advice for STEM Majors
Getting through college can be a struggle, but hopefully it will be easier with some basic advice geared specifically for STEM majors. Each point here was carefully chosen based on advice from people who completed degrees in a STEM field (including myself). These points include answers to "What should I do?", "Why should I do this?", and "When should I do this?" to be as clear and helpful as possible.

## Join interesting groups  <a name="join-group"></a>
### What should I do?
You should try out any group that sounds interesting. I don’t mean commit to the group entirely, but show up to a few meetings. Try out university groups, Meetup groups, internships, a part-time job, or an informal pickup frisbee game every Tuesday night (or, in my case, do one of each).
### Why should I do this?
-   You will quickly find out which groups are actually interesting to you and which ones just sounded interesting.
-   It is a quick and easy way to make friends on campus with similar interests, while developing your skills.
-   It will help you choose upper-division courses to focus on what you are actually interested in, versus what just sounds interesting.
### When should I do this?
It’s easiest to do this in your first year, when you are taking general education classes and other base-level classes. I enrolled in 21 credits my first semester, but still found time to work a part-time job, an internship, a university group, and even play frisbee. However, it’s never too late to start new adventures and meet new people. Even if it is your last semester, I fully recommend these experiences and making friends.
### Is there anything I should watch out for?
You should try out a lot of different groups, but don’t commit time or resources to any group unless you really like it. Some groups sound interesting, but you just don’t click with any of the other members. Other groups may be a good fit, but require too much of your time. Just walk away from those group and only commit time to the ones that you really love.
## Visit all research buildings <a name="research-buildings"></a>
### What should I do?
You should walk into all the research buildings at your university, even ones that do not seem related to your degree. Visit the buildings for physics, optics, astronomy, geology, atmospheric sciences, engineering, chemistry, biology, and even mathematics. When you visit the research buildings, ask people working in the labs what they are working on and why they like it. If you are shy, it may be easier to bring coffee or a snack and offer it to the graduate students first.

### Why should I do this?

-   For the last two years of my degree, I worked at an accelerator lab. It was awesome! But, I never would have found that opportunity without asking about research labs in related departments. The lab that I worked in was actually partially funded by the geology and atmospheric sciences departments, since the accelerator was primarily used for radiocarbon dating of geological and biological samples.
-   You can find out which specific fields you may be interested in before you need to actually commit to any particular field. Your degree may apply to a seemingly unrelated field, and research labs will help you find these sub-fields.    
-   You can start building relationships with other people in your field. These relationships are invaluable for specific career advice, finding internships, getting a part-time job, or just a monthly lunch.
    
-   You can learn about many interesting applications of physics in a pretty short amount of time.
  
### When should I do this?

You can do this pretty much any time during your degree. If you want to work a job or internship related to your field during your studies, then it is best to do this during your first year.

## Develop your interpersonal skills <a name="interpersonal-skills"></a>
### What should I do? 
If you already have solid interpersonal skills, great! If not, there is no time like the present. Either way, you should work in a job or join a group that allows you to strengthen interpersonal skills and add it to your resume/CV. I joined an outreach group that promoted interest in STEM fields through public events, demos, and school visits. Universities often have undergraduate research symposiums, so I would also recommend giving a presentation at those if possible. You can also volunteer at a local planetarium or offer to give volunteer talks to local schools if you cannot find a paid internship or part-time job.
### Why should I do this?
-   You can gain experience in soft skills that translate well to future jobs, whether in the private or public sector. Giving presentations, public speaking, relationship building, and conflict resolution are useful skills.
-   You can put it on your resume. Seriously, one of the things that STEM majors are missing is often proof of experience in interpersonal skills.
-   You can get practice explaining difficult concepts to people with no technical experience. This is an extremely useful skill to have, since you will constantly encounter people who may not have your technical knowledge. Plus, Human Resources or admissions officers, not other scientists, will often be the first ones to read your resume and applications. So, you want to be understandable to everyone.
### When should I do this?
You should get as much experience with these skills as possible throughout your college degree. This can often be accomplished by joining a group and giving presentations for a couple hours per week.

## Meet experienced students <a name="grad-students"></a>
### What should I do? 
You should get to know as many of the upper-division (undergraduates in their third or fourth year of study) and graduate students in your field as possible. Ideally, you will develop friendships with at least a few of them and gain advice from some others.  
### Why should I do this?
-   Graduate students are often the ones grading your papers, so it can be helpful to understand what they are looking for.
-   These people are helpful resources for later in your life and career as well. You can develop an ongoing friendship and see how their career progresses as well.
-   Upper-division undergraduates are an invaluable source of knowledge on university-specific information. These students can prevent a terrible semester for you by giving you specific advice. Some examples of this are “Professor Y expects you to get everything wrong, but they will grade you well if you explain your reasoning for each step of the problem”, or “this professor only cares that you get the right answer and doesn’t care at all how you got there”, or “most of this professor’s exam questions are based on XY textbook that is not assigned”.

    
## Use your college's resources <a name="college-resources"></a>
### What should I do? 
At my university, the Career Center, Rec Center, Writing & Proofreading Center, and free events were included in tuition whether or not you use them. 
Even if you’re not a gym buff, you can probably still find something interesting at the campus Rec Center. Our Rec offered a variety of services, including classes on meditation, yoga, boxing, as well as special events, organized trips, and equipment rental.  
These centers are designed to help you and, whether it’s proofreading a paper or finding job advice, you should take full advantage of them.

### Why should I do this? 
 - You’re already paying for these resources, so you may as well use them!!
 - If your essays are proofread and edited in the free writing center first, then your grades on these writing pieces are often better. 
 - For some services, you can get a significantly better rate at the Rec than anywhere else. For example, I was able to rock climb for a weekend by renting two pairs of shoes, a backpack, chalk, and a bag for about $5 for three days.

### When should I do this? 
It is best to use these resources as much as possible throughout your college degree. The earlier you identify these resources, the longer you can use them. But, using them today is better than never! 

  

## Experience the local city <a name="live-local"></a>
### What should I do? 
You should spend time learning about the city, going on local hikes, going to events and festivals, trying out various coffee and tea shops, wandering the streets to find the most beautiful places to sit and read a book, and say hello to strangers on the street. You should also check out local restaurants, even if you can’t pronounce anything on the menu.

If you are attending college in your hometown, there are still plenty of new things to do that are only available to people 18+ or 21+. Even if you’re only there for a few years, you should live those few years like a local rather than just showing up for classes and then watching Netflix.
### Why should I do this? 
 - Your college town is going to be your home for 2 - 5 years, so you should get comfortable there. 
 - You will have more fun attending college if you take time to attend local events and go to local restaurants. 
### When should I do this? 
You should do this as much as possible during your time in college, especially in evenings and weekends. 

## Find a physical activity you love <a name="be-active"></a>
### What should I do? 
You should find at least one physical activity that you love and that does not feel like exercising. For some people, this includes riding ocean waves or going for hikes. For others, it is a club sport, yoga, kickboxing, trail running, or even meditation. 
### Why should I do this? 
- College is the easiest time to explore new activities and find physical activities you love. 
- College is stressful. An effective way to deal with this stress is to exercise, especially if it is an exercise you love. 
### When should I do this? 
Ideally, you should exercise every day, as long as it is fun and you enjoy it. You should also join groups with different activities throughout the week (Frisbee on Tuesdays and Fridays, hikes on Saturdays, yoga on Mondays and Wednesdays, etc.) so that there is variety throughout the week.
